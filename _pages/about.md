            Welcome to Fatima Jinnah Women University's <strong>Speech and Language Processing Group</strong>. We develop computational models for the understanding or generation of natural language. Some of our current areas of interest are:

            <ul>
                <li>Universal natural language processing and transfer learning</li>
                <li>Natural language processing for educational applications</li>
                <li>Context-aware machine translation</li>
                <li>Low-resource machine translation</li>
            </ul>

            More details about our project can be found <a href="/projects/">here</a>. Also, check out our latest publications and participation in <a href="http://www2.statmt.org/wmt23/">WMT workshops</a>.
